## Logic and Pragmatic Inference
### Shortfall of propositional logic
PropL is a very great thing. However, it does not mean that it's perfect. In particular, PropL has its shortcomming in describing the natural language. Observes these example:

**(3)**

    a. I didn't eat 3 (of the) cookies.
    
    b. I ate fewer than 3 cookies. 

    c. There are 3 cookies that I didn't eat. 

While PropL identify (3b) as ~r, it doesn't say anything meaningful about (3c). In particular, (3c) is a completely different topic in PropL's perspective, therefore the only way we can really represent it under the PropL is through a new variable. This is not I deal as we can see that all three sentences in (3) actually related to eachother. Both (3b) and (3c) are ways that people can understand an utterance of (3a).

**(4)**

    a. Johnny finished all of the cookies.

    b. Johnny finished some of the cookies. 

Even though there is entailment, PropL can't see the scalar relationship between **all** and **some**. Therefore, these two sentences are both assigned a different variable under the eyes of PropL.

**(5)**

    a. If N is an elephant, then N is a mamal. 

I actually have no idea what's wrong with this.

#### Therefore...
We see that these three shortfalls of PropL araised because fundamentally, PropL basic unit is a clause. We need something that have a smaller grasp on the elemement of language. In particular we need something that handles:

(5). The relativities between elephant and mamal (Categories).

(4). Terms like all, some, ... (Scalar)

(3). The interaction of **n't** and **3 cookies**.
